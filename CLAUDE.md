# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project directory for developing Pine Script indicators related to dynamic RSI (Relative Strength Index). The directory is currently empty and ready for development.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently empty and awaits initial development. Based on the directory name "rsi-dynamique-pinescript", this project will likely contain:

- Pine Script files for TradingView indicators
- RSI-based technical analysis implementations
- Dynamic indicator variations

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, no specific build tools or commands have been established yet. Pine Script development typically involves:

- Writing `.pine` files for TradingView
- Testing indicators directly in TradingView's Pine Editor
- Version control for indicator iterations

## Architecture Notes

This project is at the initial stage and architectural patterns will emerge as development progresses. Pine Script projects typically follow TradingView's indicator development patterns with focus on technical analysis calculations and visualization.
